Hacking on PulseAudio#:
  * We use Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/pulseaudio-sharp and Bazaar
  * If you'd like to contribute some changes, you have a number of options:
    + Create a merge-request for your bzr branch on Launchpad
    + Create a patch in unified-diff format (diff -u) and attach it to a 
      bug on Launchpad.
    + Create a patch in unified-diff format and attach it to a mail on the
      pa-sharp-core@launchpad.net mailing list.
  * Branches and patches which include unit-tests are preferred, and
    will be looked at first.
