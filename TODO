* Testing:
  + Context tests should be audited for Ed-specificity
  + Context tests SetUp should not instantiate two sinks; each test
    which requires them should explicitly set them up.
  + Tests are starting to get too slow

* Bindings
  + Need to bind:
    - Clients
    - Cards
    - Sources
    - Source Outputs
    - Modules
    - Cached Samples
    - Audio Streams
  + Volume
    - Support for dB & linear volume
  + Sinks
    - Support for various sink capabilities: dB & linear volumes,
      latency, etc
